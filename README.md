Application uses [Nerdamer](https://nerdamer.com) scripts to solve equations for mixed strategies. For pure strategies it uses algorithm based on [MIT Pure Strategy Matrix Form Games and Nash Equilibria](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-11-insights-from-game-theory-into-social-behavior-fall-2013/study-materials/MIT14_11F13_Pure_strategy.pdf) paper.
